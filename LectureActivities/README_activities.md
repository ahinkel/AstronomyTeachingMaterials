## TransitMethodSpreadsheet

A spreadsheet built from a randomly generated light curve simulation, containing 3
planets, all with different periods.  Students must analyze/visualize the data
in order to determine how big each planet is, while also answering conceptual
questions about exoplanet detection. 


## ChallengeProblem2_HR_diagram

A spreadsheet with Gaia Space Telescope data for two star clusters: NGC188 and M67.  
The clusters are about 6 and 4 billion years old, respectively.  Therefore, the
HR Diagrams (Color-Magnitude Diagrams) built from Gaia data will look different
for each cluster.  Older clusters have had most or all of their most massive 
(blue and luminous) stars evolve off the main sequence or die, while younger
clusters still have some of these stars.  

Students are asked to utilize this data to show which cluster is older.
