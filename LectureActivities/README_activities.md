## TransitMethodSpreadsheet

A spreadsheet built from a randomly generated light curve simulation, containing 3
planets, all with different periods.  Students must analyze/visualize the data
in order to determine how big each planet is, while also answering conceptual
questions about exoplanet detection. 


## ChallengeProblem2_HR_diagram

A spreadsheet with Gaia Space Telescope data for two star clusters: NGC188 and M67.  
The clusters are about 6 and 4 billion years old, respectively.  Therefore, the
HR Diagrams (Color-Magnitude Diagrams) built from Gaia data will look different
for each cluster.  Older clusters have had most or all of their most massive 
(blue and luminous) stars evolve off the main sequence or die, while younger
clusters still have some of these stars.  

Students are asked to utilize this data to show which cluster is older.

I have already implemented data quality cuts to ensure precise distances and
photometry, and have isolated the clusters via cuts in proper motion space.
Background/field stars are minimal.


## ChallengeProblem0

A quick check of understanding regarding moon phases, and how the two-dimensional 
drawings normally done in class tend to hide some of the minutiae of moon phases.


## ChallengeProblem3_perspective

A creative assignment asking students to visualize through art (including writing)
what it might be like to live on other fictitious worlds.  The prompts are designed
to get students thinking about a number of different concepts from the course, and
also allows them freedom to include other concepts in their work.  A detailed 
explanation of their art is required to connect to the concepts in class.  For 
example: how might the night sky look when viewed from a planet around a halo star?
