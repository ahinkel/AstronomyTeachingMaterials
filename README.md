# Astronomy Teaching Materials
Some teaching materials I have developed for a college Introductory Astronomy course aimed at developing the data and programming skills of first- and second-year students.  Raw datasets are available in this repository and are also available on Kaggle.

Please see the StartHere folder to get started.

More info is available in README files in each directory/folder.

More info TBA
