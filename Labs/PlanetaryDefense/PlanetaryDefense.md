# Planetary Defense Lab (Kaggle)

NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) oversees 
the agency’s detection and ongoing tracking of asteroids and 
comets that could potentially pose a threat to the Earth.  
By continually refining measurements of an object’s position 
and velocity on the sky through repeated observations, 
astronomers are able to better predict the orbital path of 
that object via simulations.  Today, we will examine a 
simplified model of these simulations.

Suppose the PDCO has heard about your stellar performance in 
class and has asked you to help them determine the risks 
posed by several asteroids.  Your job is to run the simulations 
for the asteroids tabulated below and report the missing pieces 
to NASA.  You must also determine which of the asteroids 
(if any) pose a direct collision threat with the Earth over the 
next 50 years.
