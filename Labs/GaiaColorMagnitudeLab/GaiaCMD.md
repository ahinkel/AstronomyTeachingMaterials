# Gaia Color-Magnitude Lab

There are two versions of this lab.
(1) Students use Gaia DR3 data to plot color vs. absolute magnitude via python.
(2) Students use Gaia DR3 data and Excel to calculate stellar Temperature, Luminosity, radius, and distance for stars in the M67 open cluster and the NGC 188 open cluster.
